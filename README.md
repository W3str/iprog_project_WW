### D Level Grading Criteria

1. **Architecture/Code**
   - Application state mixed with Persistence but separated from Presenters and Views.
   - Views with multiple responsibilities/roles.
   - One module per View.
   - View-Presenter mix incidentally.

2. **Usability/User Experience/Improve Usability**
   - Somewhat clear target group, unclear benefits for the user.
   - Moderately efficient task accomplishment.
   - User feels somewhat in control.
   - Satisfactory feedback on user actions and visibility of system status.
   - Little user consultation at prototyping or formative evaluation stage.
   - Some improvement based on usability feedback from users in the target group.

3. **Web APIs and Persistence**
   - Remote data used from a single source but not creating added value for users based on the data provided by the API.
   - Clear system status shown when waiting for API requests and user can perform other actions while waiting for the response.
   - Well-separated persisted data per authenticated user.

4. **Group Cooperation**
   - Good balance of work in the group (25% of code can be multi-author).
   - Role separation in the group (per component or per concern: views, interaction model/application stateâ€¦).
   - Work amount and roles documented through individual self-reflections.
